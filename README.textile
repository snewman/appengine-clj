h1. appengine-clj

Library aimed at making life on Google AppEngine clean and easy for a Clojure app. Wirtten by John Hume, forked
by Sam Newman

h2. Building

Everything needed to build is enclosed. On the terminal, just type:

    ./run

Tests can be run using:

    ./run test

Note that the tests run and pass - but there is currently an issue whereby the task hangs at the end. 

h2. appengine-clj.users

Convenience API for the com.google.appengine.api.users package.

The <code>user-info</code> function can be called from anywhere to get the current user and a UserService. 
For a more functional approach, a Ring middlware function is provided 
to assoc the user info into every request under the key :appengine-clj/user-info. 

h2. appengine-clj.datastore

A convenience API for the com.google.appengine.api.datastore package providing access to Google's schema-free datastore.

It allows you to work with immutable data structures instead of mutable Entity instances.

<pre><code>(require '[appengine-clj.datastore :as ds])
(ds/create {:kind "Person" :name "Jimmmy" :age 25})
=> {:kind "Person" :key #<Key Person(1138)> :name "Jimmmy" :age 25}</code></pre>

h2. appengine-clj.test-utils

Provides setup and teardown of an in-memory Datastore for use in tests or from a REPL. 
If you're using <code>clojure.contrib.test-is</code>, you can use the <code>dstest</code> macro to get a fresh Datastore for each test.
